# Welcome
The RedFox32 OS project is a self learning exercise in Operating System
development.

During the development of this project I will be exploring how computer systems
work. To do this I will be creating each individual element of the software used
to interact with a computers hardware and implementing many of the features that
we are used to working with, and take for granted, in the modern world.
