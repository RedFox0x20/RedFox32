# RedFox32 Complete Repository
This is the complete project repository for the RedFox32 OS project.

This project is made up of multiple semi-modular sections and as such I have decided to construct it using multiple git repositories.

Other repositories in this project:
- [RedFox32_Bootloader](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/RedFox32_Bootloader)
- [RedFox32_Filesystem](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/RedFox32_Filesystem)
- [RedFox32_Kernel](https://github.com/RedFox0x20/RedFox32_Kernel)

# Cloning
This repository relies on `git submodules`, here's a command to clone everything you need at once!\
`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/RedFox0x20/RedFox32`
